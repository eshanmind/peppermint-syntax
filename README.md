# peppermint-syntax theme

Peppermint is a dark and cold theme. It is bright, yet still remains easy on the eyes.
born out of a desperation of wanting the Peppermint terminal theme here on atom.
Specifically designed for scripting languages.
Enjoy the minty flavored goodness!

Based on Noah Frederick's amazing macOS terminal theme: https://noahfrederick.com/log/lion-terminal-theme-peppermint
